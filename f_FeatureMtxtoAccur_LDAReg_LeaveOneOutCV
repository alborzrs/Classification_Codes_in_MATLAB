%This function performs leave-one-out cross validation on the input
%dataset and returns the accuracy using regularized LDA. 
%Inputs:
%   featureMatrix: a M-by-N matrix, where M is the number of samples and N 
%   is the number of features.
%   labels: a M-by-1 vector, with the labels of the M samples.
%   gamma: the regularization parameter for LDA. It can be between 0 and 1
accur_CV=zeros(1 ,length(labels)); % accuracy of each fold. In this case, 
% each fold consists of only one sample.
for i= 1:length(labels)  % looping through all the samples (folds)
    train=true(length(labels),1);
    train(i)=false; % setting labels for the training set
    test=~train; % setting labels for the test set
    class_LDA = fitcdiscr(featureMatrix(train,:),labels(train,:), ...
        'DiscrimType','linear','Gamma',gamma);
