# Classification_Codes_in_MATLAB
This library contains a number of cross validation and test set classification codes written in MATLAB. 

--> f_FeatureMtxtoAccur_LDAReg_KfoldCV 
This function performs a k-fold cross validation on the input dataset and returns the accuracy using regularized LDA. 

--> f_FeatureMtxtoAccur_LDAReg_LeaveOneOutCV
This function performs a leave-one-out cross validation on the input dataset and returns the accuracy using regularized LDA. 

--> f_FeatureMtxtoAccur_SVM_KfoldCV 
This function performs a k-fold cross validation on the input dataset and returns the accuracy using SVM (chosen type).
